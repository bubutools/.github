## Hi, there ðŸ‘‹

BUBU is a web-based tool where you can explore NFT collections and various NFT analytics. 

### :bar_chart: Charts are never this fun to understand! 

#### What do you expect from BUBU tools?

* You can easily filter trending collections based on their floor price, sales count, and volume for different time intervals. You can also play hide and seek with the table's columns.  
* **Search, analyze and compare** collections using our collection explorer :mag_right:. Using the magic filter box, you can visualize collections based on your desired features. 
* Did I mention minting? :hammer_and_pick: Isn't it exciting to follow recent mints? I bet it would be even more thrilling to get notified :bell: when your favorite wallets were in the act of minting. 
* You can get alerts whenever a collection floor moves, a followed wallet buys/sells an item, or something happens in your watchlist :eyes:.
* Don't let your revenue become blurry. The profit calculator will help you to understand how much you can earn from your sales.
