## Hi, there ðŸ‘‹

BUBU is a web-based tool where you can explore NFT collections and various NFT analytics. 

### :bar_chart: Charts are never this fun to understand! 

In BUBU tools:

* You can easily filter trending collections based on their floor price, sales count, and volume for different time intervals. You can also play hide and seek with the table's columns.  
* Search, analyze and compare collections using our collection explorer. Using the magic filter box, you can visualize collections based on your desired features. 
* Did I mention minting? Isn't it exciting to follow recent mints? I bet it would be even more thrilling to get notified when your favorite wallets were in the act of minting.
